README
It takes around 1-2 minutes for code to analyze a 3 hour dataset, 
takes around 30 seconds for code to analyze 1 hour dataset.

Several things worth noting:
 
0. Our peak detection code uses the findpeaks function in the R package pracma, so you 
should install the package "pracma" before running the code. You can install pracma by 
running the following line of R code: 

install.packages('pracma', repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')

1. remember to set the R project directory to the directory where these R code files are stored.
Also remember to put the DFM csv file in the same directory as the code files

2. There are sometimes NA values in the output (for example, if there is only 1 peak, then the 
time between peaks variable would be NA)
 
3. Sometimes, there are ties in the data and the nonparametric wilcoxon test 
will still run but the p values calculated might not be exact.  

The statistical tests here are mainly for the users' benefit to quickly get a rough
idea of the statistical significance. For publication/other purposes, we suggest running your own 
tailored statistical tests suitable for your experiments and data. 

4. Last but not least, all parameters are tunable! 
You can go to makePlotsAndTables.R to change the parameters of the analysis so that they are in line with your experiments and data. 

To start using the code, go to run.R and follow the instructions!
